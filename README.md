Odin Project Exercise - Rock, Paper, Scissors

V2:

Using event listeners students are tasked with creating a user interface for the rock, paper, scissors game. Fun colors were a bonus!

-------

In this exercise students are tasked with creating a simple game of rock, paper, scissors that plays in the inspector console. The game should play through five rounds and then declare a winner.


NOTE: The exercise stipulates that, since loops have not been taught in Odin Project at the time of completing this exercise, students should simply copy/paste the singleRound function instead of creating a loop.
